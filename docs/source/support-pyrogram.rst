Support Pyrogram
================

Pyrogram is free and open source software, and thus powered by your love and support! If you like the project and have
found it to be useful, give Pyrogram a `Star on GitHub`_. Your appreciation means a lot and helps staying motivated.

As a developer, you probably understand that "open source" doesn't mean "free work". A lot of time and resources has
been put into the project and if you'd like to tip me for Pyrogram -- or any of my `other works`_ -- you can use the
