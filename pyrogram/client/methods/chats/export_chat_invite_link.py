        """Generate a new invite link for a chat; any previously generated link is revoked.

        You must be an administrator in the chat for this to work and have the appropriate admin rights.

        .. note ::

            Each administrator in a chat generates their own invite links. Bots can't use invite links generated by
            other administrators. If you want your bot to work with invite links, it will need to generate its own link
            using this method – after this the link will become available to the bot via the :meth:`~Client.get_chat`
            method. If your bot needs to generate a new invite link replacing its previous one, use this method again.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier for the target chat or username of the target channel/supergroup
                (in the format @username).

        Returns:
            ``str``: On success, the exported invite link is returned.

        Raises:
            RPCError: In case of a Telegram RPC error.
            ValueError: In case the chat_id belongs to a user.
