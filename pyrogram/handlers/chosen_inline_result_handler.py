from .handler import Handler


class ChosenInlineResultHandler(Handler):
    """The ChosenInlineResultHandler handler class. Used to handle chosen inline results coming from inline queries.
    It is intended to be used with :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.add_handler`

    For a nicer way to register this handler, have a look at the
    :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.on_chosen_inline_result` decorator.

    Parameters:
        callback (``callable``):
            Pass a function that will be called when a new chosen inline result arrives.
            It takes *(client, chosen_inline_result)* as positional arguments (look at the section below for a
            detailed description).

        filters (:obj:`Filters`):
            Pass one or more filters to allow only a subset of chosen inline results to be passed
            in your callback function.

    Other parameters:
        client (:obj:`~pyrogram.Client`):
            The Client itself, useful when you want to call other API methods inside the message handler.

        chosen_inline_result (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.ChosenInlineResult`):
            The received chosen inline result.
