from .handler import Handler


class ChatMemberJoinRequestHandler(Handler):
    """The ChatMemberJoinRequest handler class. Used to handle a new member join request in a private group.
    It is intended to be used with :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.add_handler`.

    For a nicer way to register this handler, have a look at the
    :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.on_chat_member_join_request` decorator.

    Parameters:
        callback (``callable``):
            Pass a function that will be called when a new member join request arrives. It takes
            *(client, chat_member_join_request)* as positional arguments (look at the section below for a detailed
            description).

        filters (:obj:`Filters`):
            Pass one or more filters to allow only a subset of updates to be passed in your callback function.

    Other parameters:
        client (:obj:`~pyrogram.Client`):
            The Client itself, useful when you want to call other API methods inside the handler.

        chat_member_join_request (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.ChatMemberJoinRequest`):
            The received chat member join request.
