            This number may be greater than 32 bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects

        pinned_message (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message`, *optional*):
            Specified message was pinned.
            Note that the Message object in this field will not contain further reply_to_message fields even if it

                transmitted.

            progress_args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.
                You can pass anything you need to be available in the progress callback scope; for example, a Message
                object or a Client instance in order to edit the message with the updated progress status.

        Other Parameters:
            current (``int``):
                The amount of bytes transmitted so far.

            total (``int``):
                The total size of the file.

            *args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments as defined in the ``progress_args`` parameter.
                You can either keep ``*args`` or add every single extra argument in your function signature.

        Returns:
            On success, the sent :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` is returned.
            In case the upload is deliberately stopped with :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.stop_transmission`, None is returned
            instead.

            caption (``str``, *optional*):
                Photo caption, 0-1024 characters.

            parse_mode (:obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ParseMode`, *optional*):
                By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
                You can combine both syntaxes together.

            caption_entities (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.MessageEntity`):

            progress (``Callable``, *optional*):
                Pass a callback function to view the file transmission progress.
                The function must take *(current, total)* as positional arguments (look at Other Parameters below for a
                detailed description) and will be called back each time a new file chunk has been successfully
                transmitted.

            progress_args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.
                You can pass anything you need to be available in the progress callback scope; for example, a Message
                object or a Client instance in order to edit the message with the updated progress status.

        Other Parameters:
            current (``int``):
                The amount of bytes transmitted so far.

            total (``int``):

                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.
                You can pass anything you need to be available in the progress callback scope; for example, a Message

                Pass a callback function to view the file transmission progress.
                The function must take *(current, total)* as positional arguments (look at Other Parameters below for a
                detailed description) and will be called back each time a new file chunk has been successfully
                transmitted.

            progress_args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.
                You can pass anything you need to be available in the progress callback scope; for example, a Message
                object or a Client instance in order to edit the message with the updated progress status.

        Other Parameters:
            current (``int``):
                The amount of bytes transmitted so far.

            total (``int``):
                The total size of the file.

            *args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments as defined in the ``progress_args`` parameter.
                You can either keep ``*args`` or add every single extra argument in your function signature.

        Returns:
            On success, the sent :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` is returned.
            In case the upload is deliberately stopped with :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.stop_transmission`, None is returned
            instead.

        Raises:
            RPCError: In case of a Telegram RPC error.

            1.  Pass one integer argument only (e.g.: ``.click(2)``, to click a button at index 2).
                Buttons are counted left to right, starting from the top.

            2.  Pass two integer arguments (e.g.: ``.click(1, 0)``, to click a button at position (1, 0)).
                The origin (0, 0) is top-left.

            3.  Pass one string argument only (e.g.: ``.click("Settings")``, to click a button by using its label).
                Only the first matching button will be pressed.

        Parameters:
            x (``int`` | ``str``):
                Used as integer index, integer abscissa (in pair with y) or as string label.
                Defaults to 0 (first button).

            y (``int``, *optional*):
                Used as ordinate only (in pair with x).

            quote (``bool``, *optional*):
                Useful for normal buttons only, where pressing it will result in a new message sent.
                If ``True``, the message will be sent as a reply to this message.
                Defaults to ``True`` in group chats and ``False`` in private chats.

            timeout (``int``, *optional*):
                Timeout in seconds.

        Returns:
            -   The result of :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.request_callback_answer` in case of inline callback button clicks.

                By default, all files are downloaded in the *downloads* folder in your working directory.
                You can also specify a path for downloading files in a custom location: paths that end with "/"
                are considered directories. All non-existent folders will be created automatically.

            in_memory (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True to download the media in-memory.
                A binary file-like object with its attribute ".name" set will be returned.
                Defaults to False.

            block (``bool``, *optional*):
                Blocks the code execution until the file has been downloaded.
                Defaults to True.

            progress (``Callable``, *optional*):
                Pass a callback function to view the file transmission progress.
                The function must take *(current, total)* as positional arguments (look at Other Parameters below for a
                detailed description) and will be called back each time a new file chunk has been successfully
                transmitted.

            progress_args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.
                You can pass anything you need to be available in the progress callback scope; for example, a Message
                object or a Client instance in order to edit the message with the updated progress status.

        Other Parameters:
            current (``int``):
                The amount of bytes transmitted so far.

            total (``int``):
                The total size of the file.

            *args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments as defined in the ``progress_args`` parameter.
                You can either keep ``*args`` or add every single extra argument in your function signature.
