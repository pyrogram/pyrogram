        The method is analogous to the method :meth:`~Client.forward_messages`, but the copied message doesn't have a
        link to the original message.

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            from_chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the source chat where the original message was sent.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            message_id (``int``):
                Message identifier in the chat specified in *from_chat_id*.

            caption (``string``, *optional*):
                New caption for media, 0-1024 characters after entities parsing.
                If not specified, the original caption is kept.
                Pass "" (empty string) to remove the caption.

            parse_mode (:obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ParseMode`, *optional*):
                By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
                You can combine both syntaxes together.

            caption_entities (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.MessageEntity`):
                List of special entities that appear in the new caption, which can be specified instead of *parse_mode*.

            disable_notification (``bool``, *optional*):
                Sends the message silently.
                Users will receive a notification with no sound.

            reply_to_message_id (``int``, *optional*):
                If the message is a reply, ID of the original message.

            schedule_date (:py:obj:`~datetime.datetime`, *optional*):
                Date when the message will be automatically sent.

            protect_content (``bool``, *optional*):
                Protects the contents of the sent message from forwarding and saving.

            reply_markup (:obj:`~pyrogram.types.InlineKeyboardMarkup` | :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ReplyKeyboardMarkup` | :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ReplyKeyboardRemove` | :obj:`~pyrogram.types.ForceReply`, *optional*):
                Additional interface options. An object for an inline keyboard, custom reply keyboard,
                instructions to remove reply keyboard or to force a reply from the user.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message`: On success, the copied message is returned.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                # Copy a message
                await app.copy_message(to_chat, from_chat, 123)
